- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sauli! I'm 33 years old and it's my second year studying Business Information Technology in Karelia University of Applied Sciences.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m especially interested in web development (fullstack) and cyber security (absolute beginner) and I'm really keen on learning more all the time. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning mostly web development using JS/React. Backend I've mostly done with JS/Node.js/Express but in my quite rare spare time I've been learning the basics of Kotlin/Spring combo. I've also started to learn mobile development usein React Native in my spare time.

These repositories contain some school and spare time projects I've worked with or am currently working on.

Most of the projects are very experimental and mostly the content here is about me playing around with code and trying and learning different kinds of stuff, so there is a lot of "unfinished" stuff.

Most of the projects are web applications but there are some desktop Java-applications included as well. All of the Java-applications are mostly school related. There are some group projects included, but on those projects a fair share of the code is implemented by me as well.

Majority of the experimental code is unfortunately lacking comments, but project related code is commented.

Majority of the code is lacking tests, since that's something I've just recently started to get familiar with. 

Some of the languages, libraries, frameworks, database systems and tools I've used in projects:

-Javascript -HTML -CSS -React -Bootstrap -Material UI -MapBox maps -Node.js -Express -Axios -JsonWebToken -BCrypt -Jest -MySQL -Firebase -MongoDB -PostGreSQL -Azure Cognitive Services -Java
